### How to Gain Points

In this game, depending on what object SpongeBob catches, the player will either gain or loose a certain amount of points.

Spongebob wants to catch jellyfish, so if you catch them, you will gain points. However, Spongebob doesn't want to catch any trash, like boots and cans. Make sure you avoid them, because you'll loose points. Also, watch out for Karen! She and Plankton always try to sabotage Spongebob's fun, and if you accidentially run into her, you will loose the most points.

### Point Break Down

Below, you can see the point breakdown for the game.

| Object Caught | Points Gained / Lost |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Jellyfish     | + 1 point            |
| Boot          | - 2 points           |
| Can           | - 5 points           |
| Karen         | - 15 points          |
