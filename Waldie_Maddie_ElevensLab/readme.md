# Elevens Lab

## Goal
In the Elevens Lab, you will be programming a Solitaire game called elevens.  The goal is to find pairs of cards whose point values add to 11 or triplets of JQK. You will be working through several different activities to implement code to develop the Elevens game.  Work through each Activity, implement the necessary code, and complete the Moodle quizzes for each Activity. You must complete the previous Activity in order to open the next Activity. Work together collaboratively as a group to answer questions and develop your code.

## Key Concepts
Below, you will see what key concepts are covered in this lab:
* Abstract classes
* Abstract methods
* Arrays
* ArrayLists (Lists)
* Conditional Statements/Logical operations
* For loops
* Instantiating objects (new Constructor)
* Nethod calls
* Nested for loops
* Running Drivers to test your code
* Swapping values in arrays and Lists
* Writing a Class (fields, constructors, and methods)
